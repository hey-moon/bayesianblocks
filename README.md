# bayesianblocks

bayesian_lc is a user-oriented python 3 program designed to construct bayesian blocks [1] â€” optimal piecewise-constant approximation of time series. Originally written for operating with Fermi/LAT 4FGL-DR2 light curves [2], the script might be easily edited for various datasets. The principal part of the program consists of the optimal segmentation [3] and the function block_av which averages the flux in each bin. Plotting is also implemented.
